 *

 *
 *  To use it, create an instance and then begin calling AEMessageQueuePoll from your render loop,
 *  in order to poll for incoming messages on the render thread.
 *
 *  Then, use AEMessageQueuePerformSelectorOnMainThread from the audio thread, or
 *  performBlockOnAudioThread: or performBlockOnAudioThread:completionBlock: from the main thread.
