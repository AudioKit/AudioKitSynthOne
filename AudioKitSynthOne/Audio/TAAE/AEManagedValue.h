 * Managed value
 *
 *  This class manages a mutable reference to a memory buffer or Objective-C object which is both thread-safe
 *  and realtime safe. It manages the life-cycle of the buffer/object so that it can not be deallocated
 *  while being accessed on the main thread, and does so without locking the realtime thread.
 *
 *  You can use this utility to manage a single module instance, which can be swapped out for
 *  another at any time, for instance.
 *
 *  Remember to use the __unsafe_unretained directive to avoid ARC-triggered retains on the
 *  audio thread if using this class to manage an Objective-C object, and only interact with such objects
 *  via C functions they provide, not via Objective-C methods.

 *
 *  These may be nested safely.
 *
 *  If you are not using AEAudioUnitOutput, then you must call the AEManagedValueCommitPendingUpdates
 *  function at the beginning of your main render loop, particularly if you use this method. This 
 *  ensures batched updates are all committed in sync with your render loop. Until this function is
 *  called, AEManagedValueGetValue returns old values, prior to those set in the given block.

 *  then this function is already called for you within that class, so you don't need to do so yourself.
 *
 *  After this function is called, any updates made within the block passed to performAtomicBatchUpdate:
 *  become available on the render thread, and any old values are scheduled for release on the main thread.
 *
 *  Important: Only call this function on the audio thread. If you call this on the main thread, you
